// /*e) Sorting Performance and Time Complexity:

// -Time Complexity of Sorting: 
//   - The performance of sorting depends on the algorithm used. Common sorting algorithms include:
//     - Bubble Sort: Time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case, making it inefficient for large arrays.
//     - Quick Sort: Average time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), but the worst case is \(O(n^2)\) (this can be improved by using a random pivot).
//     - Merge Sort: Always \(O(n \log n)\), but it requires additional space for merging.
  
  
// - Sorting performance:
//   - Merge Sort :is preferred for large datasets because its \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity is predictable and stable.
//   - Quick Sort :is often the fastest in practice due to its low constant factors, but in the worst case, itâ€™s slower than Merge Sort.
//   - Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort a:re typically only useful for small datasets or nearly sorted data.

// Sorting introduces a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) in the best algorithms
